>> you are at ‘The final step is to change the line that makes the render object to be this:’ 

you found a bug and did a fix but it is still blank. reddit ask to see your code. so you need to learn how to use git to share code. 

*TODOS*:
>> it is ‘ok’ but you are getting a blank doc so you need to fix it. 

*NOTES* 

FRAME WORK:

A web application may use a combination of a base HTTP application server, a storage mechanism such as a database, a template engine, a request dispatcher, an authentication module and an AJAX toolkit. These can be individual components or be provided together in a high level framework.

web.py is a small web frame work. that means you can use python to serve up web pages. 

Django is another alternative web frame work. it looks like the main one and is ‘DRY’ (don’t repeat yourself)
	Looks like this is the one you need to learn. 

there are some free django resources here:http://bafflednerd.com/learn-python-online/

MySQL or Postgres these are *databases*. 
		
It is an open source ‘relational database 					management 	system’. field in the data relate to 			other things. so by design you can search by name. 
		
It is were user info is stored on the 						host server. it is like a spreadsheet of the data 

Apache: 

This is web server HTTP software. 

This does not seem to be a part of django.

hostname: 

this is the human readable part of the webpage. it relates to a number called an IP address. witches which is the equivalent of the computres phone number. 

urls can have a ’trailing path’ this relates to a file that they are pointing at.

protocol: i.e. http. or ftp. what tipe of files are being sent. 

Request: 
if the trailing path at the end of your url is ‘/book/‘ then you are requesting the ‘book’ file from the host sevrer. but they don’t have to be files. in ex50 the server is returning the thing our code makes. 

Response: 
this is the file or the page wrapped in a heading. 

server: 

this is a computer that is hosting the files or code that make up the website.
